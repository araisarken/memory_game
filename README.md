### How It Works  
1. Card Setup:     - The items array contains the details of each card (name and image).  
   - The randomize function shuffles the cards to ensure they appear in a random order every time.  
2. Card Flipping:     - Clicking a card triggers the flipCard function, which visually flips the card and checks for matches.  
3. Matching Logic:  
   - If two flipped cards match, they stay face-up.     - If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay using the checkMatch function.  
4. Timer and Moves Counter:  
   - The startTimer function starts counting seconds when the game begins.     - Every time a pair of cards is flipped, the move counter increments.

### Future Enhancements  
1. Add difficulty levels (e.g., more cards for advanced levels).  
2. Include sound effects for card flips and matches.  3. Save the best time and moves in local storage for a leaderboard.  
4. Add themes for cards (e.g., animals, fruits, emojis).
